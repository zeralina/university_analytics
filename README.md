**UNIVERSITY ANALYTICS**

We will analyse the universities that meet the following criteria:
- the university must have more than 30 per cent international students;
- the university must have more than 3000 students;
- the university must have more than 1500 female students.
  
We need to create a function that will output the following data for universities that fulfil our criteria:
- Average of all scores except the OverAll Score (OverAll Score). That is, we want to calculate the average Teaching Score, Research Score, Citations Score, Industry Income Score, International Outlook Score for all universities that fit our criteria, and then calculate the average of the 5 obtained values once again;
- Average Teaching Score for all eligible universities;
- The average number of staff for all eligible universities;
- Number of countries where at least one university fulfils our conditions.
